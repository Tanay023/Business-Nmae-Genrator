# Business Name Generator

This JavaScript project generates unique business names based on three user-provided input words.

**How it Works:**

1. **User Input:** The user enters three words into the input fields.
2. **Random Number Generation:** Three unique random numbers between 1 and 3 are generated.
3. **Word Assignment:** Each random number is associated with one of the input words.
4. **Name Generation:** The three words are concatenated in the order determined by the random numbers to create a unique business name.
5. **Display:** The generated business name is displayed on the screen.

**Usage:**

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter three words into the input fields.
3. Click the "Generate" button.
4. A unique business name will be displayed below the button.

**Code Structure:**

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the user interface, including input fields, a button, and a display area for the generated name.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for handling user input, generating random numbers, assigning words, and displaying the business name.

**To Run:**

1. Open the project directory in a code editor.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

**Feel free to customize and improve the project by:**

- Adding more input fields for more words.
- Implementing more complex logic for name generation.
- Enhancing the user interface with styling and animations.

**Example:**

If the user enters "Creative", "Tech", and "Solutions", the generated business name could be "TechCreativeSolutions" or "SolutionsTechCreative", depending on the random numbers generated.
